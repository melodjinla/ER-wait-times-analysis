Emergency Room Wait Time Analysis

This project analyzes hospital-level emergency room data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to identify variation in patient wait times across states and individual facilities. The dataset includes reported median wait times for patients who were either admitted to the hospital or discharged from the emergency department.

Tools & Methods
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):
Used for cleaning the dataset, calculating state-level averages, identifying the longest wait times by facility, and generating visualizations.

Power BI:
Used to build an interactive dashboard that compares average wait times across states and displays the top ten hospitals with the longest reported wait times.

Python Script:
Used to keep the workflow consistent and reproducible, including all data processing steps.

Key Insights
State-Level Differences:
Puerto Rico, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. had the longest average emergency room wait times, while states like North Dakota and Nebraska reported much shorter waits.

Facility-Level Bottlenecks:
Multiple hospitals in Texas were among the top ten with the highest reported wait times. Several hospitals reported median times exceeding 2,000 minutes.

Visualization Benefit:
The dashboard and visual summaries help highlight systemic delays and give a clear view of how emergency room efficiency varies nationwide.

Project Summary
By combining Python scripting and a Power BI dashboard, this project provides an accessible view into variation in emergency room performance across the United States. The analysis surfaces patterns in long wait times and supports more targeted investigation into facility-level or regional inefficiencies. Together, the code and dashboard allow for both detailed inspection and high-level exploration of emergency care performance.
